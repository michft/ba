Some terminal prompts
=====================



root.ba to /root/.bash_aliases

user.ba to /home/USER/.bash_aliases



root red

user yellow with username in prompt.



assume neither so have install.sh complete

-  .bash_aliases needs to be referenced by /etc/bash.bashrc.
-  __git_ps should resolves to a bash function.
