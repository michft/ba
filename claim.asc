when I recived my luggage at Melbourne Airport I noticed it looked Crumpled, when I picled it off the conveyor belt ir has a snap in the plastic at its base and the wheel wasbend sideways.

I went to the Service desk near the baggage carosel.

when a lady came to the desk I lifted my bag to the desk and stated that my baggage had been damaged during thee flight and asked how to claim for the damages.

the lady at the desk stated that wheels were not covered.

I stated that it wasn't the wheel but they had crushed the axel

she said they didn't consider it damage if the bag did not have a hole in it.

I asked again how do I mage a claim.

She pointed at the QR code near the desk and sated to make a statement there.

I did not have my name taken nor I ask her name.
